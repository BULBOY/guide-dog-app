- ðŸ”Š **Audio Feedback** - Announces detected objects with distance and position information
- ðŸ“± **Mobile Optimized** - Designed for smartphones with touch-friendly interface
- ðŸŽ¨ **Visual Framing** - Colour-coded frames around detected objects on camera feed
- ðŸ“¹ **OBS Virtual Camera Support** - Test with pre-recorded videos or screen capture
- â™¿ **Accessibility Focused** - Screen reader compatible with high contrast mode

## Granting Permissions

The app requires the following permissions:

- ðŸ“· **Camera Access**: For object detection and navigation
- ðŸ”Š **Audio Playback**: For text-to-speech feedback

## How to Use the Application

### First Time Setup

1. **Welcome Screen**: Tap anywhere to start
2. **Permissions**: Grant camera access when prompted

### Basic Navigation

1. **Start Navigation**: Press the "Start Navigation" button
2. **Object Detection**: Point camera at your environment
3. **Audio Feedback**: Listen for object announcements
4. **Manual Description**: Press "Describe All Objects" for immediate feedback

### Settings and Controls

**Verbosity Levels:**
- **Low**: Only critical alerts
- **Medium**: Important objects and updates
- **High**: Comprehensive environment information

**Announcement Modes:**
- **All Objects**: Announces all detected objects
- **Closest Only**: Only announces the nearest object

**Visual Modes:**
- **Normal View**: Camera feed with coloured object frames

### Object Framing

Objects detected in the camera feed are automatically framed with coloured borders:

- ðŸ”´ **Red**: Very close objects (< 1.5 meters) - Immediate attention required
- ðŸŸ  **Orange**: Close objects (< 3 meters) - Caution advised
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow**: Medium distance (< 5 meters) - Be aware
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green**: Farther objects (> 5 meters) - No immediate concern

## Using OBS Virtual Camera

### Setup OBS Studio

1. Download and install OBS Studio
2. Add a video source (camera, media file, or screen capture)
3. Click "Start Virtual Camera" in OBS

### Connect to App

1. In the AI Guide Dog app, click "Use OBS" button
2. If OBS Virtual Camera isn't detected, click "Refresh List"
3. Select "OBS Virtual Camera" from the dropdown

### Use Cases for OBS

- **Testing**: Use pre-recorded videos to test object detection
- **Demonstrations**: Show the app using screen capture
- **Training**: Create specific scenarios for testing
- **Accessibility**: Apply filters to improve visibility

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Camera Not Working**
- If needed, select the camera twice to activate it
- Ensure browser permissions are granted
- Try refreshing the page
- Check if another application is using the camera
- Verify HTTPS connection (required for camera access)

**No Audio Feedback**
- Check device volume
- Ensure browser audio permissions
- Try different browsers (Chrome works best)

**Poor Object Detection**
- Ensure good lighting
- Keep the camera steady
- Clean camera lens
- Point the camera at recognisable objects
- Wait for models to load fully

**Performance Issues**
- Close other browser tabs
- Restart the browser
- Check available RAM
- Try a lower camera resolution

### Browser Compatibility

- **Recommended**: Chrome on Android/Desktop, Safari on iOS
- **Supported**: Firefox, Edge
- **Limited**: Older browsers may have reduced functionality

### Mobile-Specific Issues

**iOS Safari:**
- Ensure "Camera" permission is enabled in Settings > Safari
- Try adding to the home screen for better performance

**Android Chrome:**
- Grant microphone and camera permissions
- Disable battery optimisation for the browser

## Privacy and Security

- **Local Processing**: All object detection happens on your device
- **No Data Collection**: Camera feeds are not stored or transmitted
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet after initial setup
- **Open Source**: Code is transparent and auditable
